# ucu_labs

This is a repo with all my labs from the last year collected in a single place.

**"poc"** directory contains mainly C++ essentials, working with Assembly and studying the embedded programming.

**"acs"** contains further development with C++, where I was studying the methods of optimization
using the tools for parallel programming provided by the language.
